# WayAway Plus: Real Cash Back on Flights, Up to 10% on Hotels, 24/7 Travel Support

So you've been booking flights the old-fashioned way—comparing prices across a dozen tabs, wondering if you're actually getting a deal, then paying full price anyway. What if I told you there's a platform that not only finds you cheaper flights but actually pays you back? Not in points that expire. Not in "credits" you can only use on their site. Real money. To your PayPal.

That's WayAway. And honestly? It's kind of wild that more people don't know about it yet.

## What Exactly Is WayAway?

Think of WayAway as that friend who's obsessed with finding deals—except this friend has access to over 1,000 airlines and travel agencies, scans prices in seconds, and then hands you cash after your trip.

At its core, WayAway is a flight search engine (similar to Skyscanner or Kayak). You type in where you want to go, it shows you the cheapest options from hundreds of sources, and you book directly with the airline or agency. No sketchy middleman. No hidden fees.

But here's where it gets interesting: WayAway Plus, their membership program, gives you actual cashback on your bookings. Flights, hotels, car rentals, tours—everything. And when I say "actual cashback," I mean dollars deposited straight into your PayPal account, ready to spend on whatever you want.

## The WayAway Plus Membership: How It Works

Here's the deal. WayAway Plus costs **$49.99 per year**. That's about $4 a month. For that, you get:

- **Up to 5% cashback on flights** (imagine getting $50 back on a $1,000 international flight)
- **Up to 10% cashback on hotel bookings** through Booking.com
- **5-10% cashback on car rentals**, tours, attractions, and more
- **24/7 customer support** for any travel question (seriously—visa requirements, flight changes, local restaurant recommendations, anything)
- **Exclusive city guides** created by local experts in 95+ cities
- **Price alerts** so you never miss a deal

They also offer a **7-day free trial**, so you can test it out before committing.

Now, you might be thinking: "Another subscription? Really?" Fair. But here's the thing—most people make back their $49.99 membership on a single trip. One weekend getaway. One business flight. That's it.

## Let's Talk Numbers: How Much Can You Actually Save?

I know, I know. "Up to 10% cashback" sounds like marketing speak. So let me show you some real examples travelers have shared:

### Example 1: Weekend Trip (NYC to LA)
- **Round-trip flight**: $282 → **$14 cashback** (5%)
- **3-night hotel on Booking.com**: $619 → **$62 cashback** (10%)
- **Car rental**: $183 → **$9 cashback** (5%)
- **Total cashback**: $85

Your $49.99 membership? Already paid off. And you still have 11 months left.

### Example 2: International Trip (Houston to Rome)
- **Round-trip flights for 2 people**: $1,400 → **$70 cashback** (5%)
- **5-night hotel**: $750 → **$75 cashback** (10%)
- **Tours and activities**: $300 → **$24 cashback** (8%)
- **Total cashback**: $169

That's more than triple your membership cost. On one trip.

### Example 3: Budget Traveler (Europe Backpacking)
Even if you're traveling on a shoestring, the savings add up. One traveler reported saving over $800 on a New York to Seattle flight compared to Skyscanner—and that was before cashback.

## The Features That Actually Matter

### 1. Real Cash, Not Points
Look, I'm tired of "rewards programs" that give you points you can only redeem on overpriced hotels or flights with blackout dates. WayAway deposits real money into your PayPal. Spend it on groceries. Save it for your next trip. Buy a fancy coffee. Whatever.

### 2. 24/7 Customer Support
This is huge. Planning a trip to Thailand and confused about visa requirements? Need help with a last-minute flight change? Have questions about traveling with pets? WayAway's support team is available around the clock. No extra charge. No waiting three days for an email response.

One user shared how they messaged support at 2 AM asking about baggage policies for a budget airline—got a detailed response in under 10 minutes.

### 3. Local Expert Guides
WayAway has partnered with locals in over 95 cities to create "Cities in a Nutshell" guides. These aren't generic tourist traps. They're insider tips: the best neighborhood for street food in Bangkok, hidden art galleries in Paris, where to watch the sunset in Lisbon.

### 4. Price Alerts & Flexible Dates
Set up alerts for specific routes, and WayAway notifies you when prices drop. Or use their flexible date search to find the cheapest day to fly that week. These features alone can save you hundreds.

### 5. Budget Airlines Included
Here's something other aggregators won't tell you: they often exclude budget airlines like Ryanair, AirAsia, and Spirit because those carriers don't pay listing fees. WayAway includes them all. That's how people are finding flights for $18 domestically and $25 cross-country.

## What Travelers Are Saying

I dug through dozens of reviews to see if WayAway lives up to the hype. Here's what keeps coming up:

**The Good:**
- "Saved over $800 on flights compared to Expedia" – Multiple users
- "Got $168 cashback on a family trip—more than paid for my membership" – Boston to Vegas traveler
- "The local guides are incredible. Found restaurants in Rome I never would've discovered otherwise" – Italy traveler
- "24/7 support actually works. Asked about a baggage issue at 3 AM and got help immediately" – International traveler
- Average rating: **4.5 out of 5 stars** on Trustpilot

**The Not-So-Good:**
- Cashback takes 30-120 days to process (you need to complete your trip first)
- You need at least $10 accumulated before you can cash out
- One user mentioned getting confused about which flights qualified for cashback

Honestly? These feel like minor inconveniences compared to getting hundreds of dollars back per trip.

## WayAway vs. The Competition

Let me break down how WayAway stacks up against other flight search engines:

| **Feature** | **WayAway Plus** | **Skyscanner** | **Expedia** | **Kayak** |
|-------------|------------------|----------------|-------------|-----------|
| **Real Cash Cashback** | ✅ Up to 10% | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Budget Airlines** | ✅ All included | ⚠️ Some missing | ⚠️ Limited | ⚠️ Limited |
| **Hidden Fees** | ❌ None | ⚠️ Sometimes | ✅ Common | ⚠️ Sometimes |
| **24/7 Support** | ✅ Included | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Local Travel Guides** | ✅ 95+ cities | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Price Alerts** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |

The cashback alone sets WayAway apart. No other major flight aggregator offers real money back.

## How to Get Started (And Maximize Your Savings)

Ready to try it? Here's how to make the most of WayAway Plus:

**Step 1: Start with the 7-day free trial**
👉 **[Sign up here](https://wayaway.io)** and explore the platform without paying anything upfront.

**Step 2: Set price alerts for your next trip**
Even if you're not traveling soon, set alerts for routes you're interested in. You'll start seeing patterns in pricing and can book when fares drop.

**Step 3: Book everything through WayAway**
Don't just use it for flights. Book your hotel on Booking.com through WayAway's portal. Rent a car through Rentalcars. Book tours through Viator. Every transaction earns cashback.

**Step 4: Ask questions**
Use that 24/7 support. They're not just there for emergencies. Ask about local customs, restaurant recommendations, transportation options. Get your money's worth.

**Step 5: Wait for your cashback**

## Is WayAway Plus Actually Worth It?

Let's be real: if you travel once a year or less, you might not get enough value out of the membership. The free version of WayAway is still great for finding cheap flights.

But if you:
- Take **2+ trips per year** (even short ones)
- Regularly book hotels or car rentals
- Value having support when things go wrong
- Want to actually profit from your travel planning

Then yeah, WayAway Plus basically pays for itself—and then some.

The math is simple. Book one $500 flight and a $300 hotel through WayAway Plus, and you've earned $55 in cashback. Your $49.99 membership is covered, and you're already in profit.

## The Bottom Line

Travel is expensive. Flights, hotels, car rentals—it all adds up fast. So when there's a platform that not only finds you better deals but actually gives you real money back, why wouldn't you use it?

WayAway isn't perfect. The cashback takes time to process, and you need to remember to book everything through their portal. But for most travelers, those are minor trade-offs for getting hundreds of dollars back per year.

Think about your last trip. How much did you spend on flights and hotels? Now imagine getting 5-10% of that back. As cash. That you can spend on anything.

That's WayAway Plus.

Because here's the thing: you're going to book travel anyway. You might as well get paid to do it.
